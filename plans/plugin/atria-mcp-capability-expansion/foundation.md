# Atria MCP Capability Expansion — Foundation

> Governance 1.1 migration: the detailed Plan text below is preserved from the former monolithic Plan; this module now owns only the domain named above.

## 1. Purpose

Expand Atria MCP from the current source/API/browser development bridge into a high-visibility Atria development authority for AI clients.

The intended role is not to replace Claude Code, Codex, Git, the editor, shell, tests or the normal development workflow. Atria MCP should instead give an AI reliable, Atria-specific visibility into:

- the configured Atria product checkout;
- relevant repository evidence and change impact;
- Atria-owned contracts and Native APIs;
- Build / Studio project state and source files;
- runtime state exposed through Atria authority;
- the real running frontend, including embedded previews;
- browser diagnostics and visual evidence;

The long-term mental model is:

> Atria MCP is the AI's Atria-specific eyes, diagnostic instruments and controlled product-operation bridge. Normal coding tools remain responsible for editing source and running the general development toolchain.

## 2. Existing baseline

The Plugin implementation baseline remains `plugin@c125b2e7b63ed035a0a253c4036cbdb6bd273225`. No MCP implementation work has occurred since the original design freeze.

The current MCP already provides:

- Native API discovery from the configured tracked product working tree;
- Atria authoring contract/reference access;
- bounded source search/read for tracked `src/**`, `public/**`, `scripts/**`, `tests/**`;
- discovered Native JSON API calls;
- an isolated Playwright browser;
- accessibility snapshots, screenshots, iframe inspection and responsive resizing;
- warning/error, page exception, failed request and HTTP error diagnostics;
- optional confirmed UI interaction and non-GET Native API calls;
- explicit secret/credential endpoint blocking and output redaction.

## 3. Agreed product philosophy

### 3.1 Default broad observation

Read/observation capabilities should be broad enough that an AI can understand Atria without guessing from isolated source snippets.

The target includes, subject to safety boundaries:

- Git-tracked repository tree and text files;
- source/config/build/test/workflow evidence;
- Git state and change evidence;
- Atria Native API reads;
- Build / Studio project reads;
- Session/runtime reads exposed by Atria;
- Library / Package / Memory / related product-state reads where Atria exposes an appropriate authority;
- browser structure and screenshots;
- browser/runtime diagnostics.

The goal is close to "anything needed to observe Atria" rather than "only selected source folders".

### 3.2 Product authority remains authoritative

Atria-owned runtime/project/user data must be read through Atria's own authority/API when possible.

MCP must not gain equivalent visibility by bypassing the product and scanning or mutating the underlying user data store directly.

Examples:

- Build project files should be read through Studio/ProjectStore-facing Native APIs.
- Session/chat state should be read through Session/chat authority.
- Library/Package data should be read through their product authority.
- Memory/runtime state should use the owning product surface.

This preserves the distinction between "what Atria believes its state is" and raw storage implementation details, which is essential for diagnosing projection, persistence and runtime bugs.

### 3.3 No generic computer-control escape hatch

Even after capability expansion, Atria MCP should not become a generic remote-control server.

The design should not add general-purpose capabilities such as:

- arbitrary shell execution;
- arbitrary filesystem reads outside the configured Atria scope;
- arbitrary JavaScript evaluation in the page;
- unrestricted SQL/database access;
- unrestricted network tooling.

Atria-specific, semantically named capabilities are preferred.

## 4. Repository observation direction

The current `atri_source_read` / `atri_source_search` scope is limited to selected folders and extensions.

The intended direction is to introduce a repository-level read layer capable of observing the full Git-tracked Atria checkout while retaining explicit exclusions for sensitive or unsuitable content.

Candidate capabilities include:

- `atri_repo_tree`;
- `atri_repo_read`;
- `atri_repo_search`;
- `atri_git_status`;
- `atri_git_diff`;
- `atri_git_log`;
- `atri_git_show`;
- potentially other bounded Git-read evidence where it directly helps impact analysis.

The existing source-oriented tools may remain as convenient semantic shortcuts rather than being forced to represent every repository file as "source".

Sensitive/local data such as `.env*`, credentials, Secret storage, caches, node_modules, arbitrary data roots and paths outside the configured product checkout remain outside the default repository-read authority.
